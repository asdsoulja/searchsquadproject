**Searchify**

For our project we are making a dictionary app that will allow a user to search up the definition of a word. In the case the word isn’t in the database, the application can prompt the user with a button that sends them to a google search of the word. The user will also be able to scroll through a sidebar with all the words included in the app. A side feature we also include in the app is a randomly chosen ‘word of the day’ which takes a word from the database to highlight that day.
